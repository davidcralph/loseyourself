Lose yourself, programmer edition. Based on a tweet by [@kvlly](https://twitter.com/kvlly)!

## About
Someone linked me [this](https://twitter.com/kvlly/status/1167214748225720325) tweet by @kvlly on Discord. After some researching, I found a comment by [dusty-trash](https://www.reddit.com/user/dusty-trash) on Reddit saying ``Someone should a github page for this and allow everyone to commit to it. !remind me 2 days``.

Here's the GitHub page. Pull requests will be merged depending on like/dislike ratio!

## Lyrics
```
[@kvlly]
His palms are sweaty
Knees weak, arms are heavy
The unit tests are failing already
Code spaghetti

He's nervous,
But at his laptop he looks calm and ready
To squash bugs
But he keeps on forgetting

[@ocswaynee]
What he typed out
The key taps grow so loud
He checks his commits
But the logs won’t turn out
He’s spacing, how
Everybody’s pacing now 
The clock’s run out, deadline
It’s due now!

[@ardalis]
Snap back to the IDE
Oh, there goes TDD
Oh there goes habits he knows
He’s so mad but he goes
Deeper in debt that easy
No, he won’t have it
He knows, his old build server 
Woke, he knows his whole build will be broke
It don’t matter, he’ll cope
He knows a back door he wrote...

[@littlechrob]
But its not responsive, it shows, 
When he checks his mobile chrome, 
that's when its,
back to the board again yo, just another sprint
he better go capture the moment,
before the frameworks change again

[@sorinpopescu_]
You better lose yourself in the code, put all on the hold
You wrote it, but the module you don't own it
You get only one commit, better not miss it
This development comes ones in a lifetime you better

You better lose yourself in the code, put all on the hold
You wrote it, but the module you don't own it
You get only one commit, better not miss it
This development comes ones in a lifetime you better

[u/DrunkTankGunner]
Good code escapes him, security flaws that are gapin’
His user’s yours for the taking, makes you think
As we toward a-nother preorder
Test writin’s borin’, but coffee’s pourin’,
Sunrise till early mornin’, stayin’ up only grows harder,
Pot grows hotter, he blows but then spills it all over
His clothes, it’s all on em, a bitter roast shows,
He’s known as a crap coder, janky codes,
Only he knows, what the logic is
But what he can’t decode are his wife and kids.
